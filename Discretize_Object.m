function Discretize_Object(NumSource)

%%%%% no idea how to do this %%%%%
%
% Need: 
%   Some systematic way to split the data and
%   geometry into several parts according to 
%   the discretize dictionary prescribed with 
%   the object 
%
% Something that might help: 
%   the object is usually slender and therefore 
%   has one longitudinal direction. like a club 
%   or a sword or something like that
%
%   Depends on the mesh.

% Use something like an octree data structure
